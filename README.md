Blood-Base is a blockchain-based platform designed to improve transparency and security in Pakistan's blood management system. It tracks
blood donations from donor registration to transfusion, ensuring real-time
data and reducing risks like illegal blood trading. By integrating with
healthcare systems and automating processes through smart contracts,
Blood-Base enhances the efficiency, accountability, and availability of safe
blood supplies.
Leveraging Hyperledger Fabricâ€™s permissioned architecture, this research aims to develop a decentralized blood donation management system that automates critical workflows.
Ensures data immutability, and provides real-time tracking capabilities
Focuses as an integrator technology solution with tokenization and blockchain with security hardening.
